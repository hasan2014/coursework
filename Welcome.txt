Welcome to Wakari Enterprise!

This file is located in the shared project directory.  
All members of the project have access to the files in this directory.

The public directory is for files that you want to share (read-only) with people that are not members of the project.  
The project must be a Public project in order for non-team members to access the public directory.  

The envs folder is the recommended location for creating project environments.

See the Wakari Enterprise documentation for more information.  http://docs.wakari.io
